# TalkToFiles: Conversational RAG Chatbot

TalkToFiles is a web application built using **Gradio** and **Haystack**, designed to enable users to upload documents and interact with their content through a conversational AI interface. This chatbot leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to provide accurate and context-aware answers by retrieving information from document content.
